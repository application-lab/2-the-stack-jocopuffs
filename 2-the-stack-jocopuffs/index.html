            <p class="26">The specific problem I identified <br> was using the Reddit INTERFACE.<br> This is an issue because the<br>interface of Reddit leads the user<br>to interesting content that all<br>revolve around visual stimulation,<br>meaning you can easily inadvertently<br>ignore the dangers nearby.</p>
